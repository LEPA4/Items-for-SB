# Items-for-SB
It's a minecraft plugin for a minecraft server. I'm still learning how spigot dev works which is why the code is pretty messy and un-optimized.

Note - All the code might change if I decide to use nms (if I figure it out), The switch would require me to learn how to make it cross platform compatible.
