# Items-for-SB
It's a minecraft plugin for a minecraft server. I'm still learning how spigot dev works which is why the code is pretty messy and un-optimized.

Note - All the code might change if I decide to use nms (if I figure it out), The switch would require me to learn how to make it cross platform compatible.

## Other Stuff
I am always happy to get help on projects. Create an issue or something: it's the only way I can think of RN.

I'm also going to work on commenting code and writing documentation for it.

Currently requires newest protocollib but is unused ATM.

## The Vison

What is it that this plugin is for? I want to make a skyblock server or a "mega survival" server that is heavily based on players interacting with one another. This is a large project that will be compiled of multiple plugins (or all of them in one).
I want there to be a player-run Auction house and hypixel bazzar-esque shop. There are going to be many new blocks and items.
There might be opportunity to add in crates but I don't want it pay-to-win, unlike many mega survival servers. The only thing ranks might be used for is to create more profiles or unlock things faster --- There will be a skills system and also cosmetics (cosmetics will be one of the only things you pay for)
