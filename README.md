# Items-for-SB
It's a minecraft plugin for a minecraft server. I'm still learning how spigot dev works which is why the code is pretty messy and un-optimized.

Note - All the code might change if I decide to use nms (if I figure it out), The switch would require me to learn how to make it cross platform compatible.

## Other Stuff
I am always happy to get help on projects. Create an issue or something: it's the only way I can think of RN.

I'm also going to work on commenting code and writing documentation for it.

Currently requires newest protocollib but is unused ATM.
